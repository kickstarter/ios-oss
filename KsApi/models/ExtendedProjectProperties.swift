 TODO:
 This model is meant to replace `Project` which has almost been converted to use GraphQL properties.

 We're not replacing it completely right now because it has a lot of large dependencies to other models (`Backing`, `User`, `Reward`).

 Also a lot of `/v1/` endpoints still use this model so we cannot completely clean-up/remove/re-think and adjust in-app functionality to address each property's use-cases.

 This property will eventually replace `Project`, but right now we're using it to build out additional functionality that only comes from GraphQL.

Reggie's been dead for some time now. Nothing really phases him. But Spencer...that's <em>another</em> story. Actually it isn't, that's <em>this</em> story. <em>The After Death</em> is Spencer figuring out-the hard way-that death doesn't solve all your problems. It might even create a few. In fact, it's not so different than life, except you don't eat and you don't sleep and, well...if you back the project, you can read all about it. </p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41286198\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/286/198/4deff7560f32fdc156526699499a7a49_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686694858&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=98c30f0086fc874a0c31b6c0c24a7046\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41286199\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/286/199/0876cb1db98c3426cd009e9edb38361c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686694880&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=eddaabbe28f475a96de4d452374716c3\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em>The After Death</em> began in 2019 during a year spent writing short comic stories and zines once a month. It was only after I started writing, drawing, and sharing the entire journey of <em>The After Death</em> zine did people go out of their way to tell me how much they loved \"the ghosts!\" And so, I kept telling their story. What began as a zine, was then turned into a comic strip. But soon it outgrew that iteration and demanded to become the epic story that's being told today. Which is sort of the thing. This story's not done!</p>\n<p>And it won't be for some time now. But, if I wait to print <em>that</em> story, it'll be huge and much more expensive. So I'm breaking it down into manageble chunks. This Kickstarter will be the start of it all: Book One. Which will cover the first two major story arcs and bring the reader up against the third that will be continued into Book Two-to be Kickstarted later.</p>\n<p>Since I've been working on this comic since 2019 the good news is, this part of the story-Book One-is done. It's finished, and ready to be printed. Besides ordering some extra goodies such as stickers, perks and guest art prints, this things ready to be brought into the world and shared with you. All we need is your help to get this project to the printer, and then into your hands. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h:A-note-about-style\" class=\"page-anchor\">A note about style</h1>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41339419\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/339/419/57cd7aa0d018dc44a2afd657a240a6d5_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1687130714&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=44b0580caaefc3f76d15ea6cbe3c9587\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em>The After Death</em> is all drawn traditionally using pencil, ink and paper. The color is done using color pencils. The only thing digital is the lettering and word balloons that I add in afterword. I know this is a cartooning no-no, but it's how I've always worked. The use of color pencil as well as the traditional drawing method tends to tug on readers nostalgic strings as they often reference <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> or <em>Peanuts</em>, etc. when trying to pin down the style. But let me be the first to tell you I do not want to be compared to the likes of those two comic greats. My style came simply because I really love to sit at the desk and play. It's not that I can't make the leap to digital comic-making, but rather I don't want to. Traditional methods has been my wheelhouse for some time now, and I think I'll stick to it. Similarly, when it came to decide how to add color to these comics, I wanted to stick with my traditional methods and so color pencils seemed a natural choice. All of the comics are drawn on color pencil paper that has a nice toothy texture throughout, which adds to the charming style that's the hallmark of <em>The After Death</em> comics. Huh, and here I was thinking it was the writing.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h:Book-One-\" class=\"page-anchor\">Book One.</h1>\n<p><em>The After Death-Book One</em>, is the first two major story arcs, but it also leans into the third a bit more before the book ends. It took me a while to figure exactly where a good stopping point would be. It's not exactly a cliff-hanger, but it does leave the reader excited for what may come next. This first book should be between 56-60 pages. Not including end papers, title pages, etc. Its a softcover edition and will measure 8 1/2 inches x 8 1/2 inches square. It's been a labor of love to write, draw and color this whole story and I'm very excited to create a real, bound book and put it out into the world!</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"Cover image for Book One-the actual cover may have minor changes.\" data-id=\"41286308\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/286/308/7cd453c34584b76aed68c23b49878687_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686695964&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=a5c515224b10f8595fcaf6ff8834b33d\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Cover image for Book One-the actual cover may have minor changes.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h1 id=\"h:-On-to-the-good-stuff-rewards-\" class=\"page-anchor\">\n<strong>On</strong> <strong>to the good stuff: rewards!</strong>\n</h1>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41324627\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/324/627/a8cb52b2b713d278b746d10c9da60b77_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686961035&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=90104dc54051eba245d15fdaf8d93970\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41324632\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/324/632/5a38332436c35f92f873dce8cc51cbec_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686961074&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e37013844937cffdc32d8992d28df6b5\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41324638\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/324/638/6742d401ac6fa145f811ec64c47c6306_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1686961114&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=8fc3bade672b6fb8458444c7fa3f0bf3\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41432944\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/432/944/01433a8cbbd7676ff74e00b0fd42c360_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1687882820&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4a6f280d2ad2d41f0aae50ec32725482\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41432835\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/432/835/4d9ac66e564d22a5053a3a90097b4cea_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1687882305&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ee018bc7eb842fdf5e617b21f0008137\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em>*I've also have itemized add-ons where you can pick your favorite reward package and then add on extras a-la cart if there's something missing that you really want!</em></p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41339132\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/339/132/81ac9206e05d91b004e89b3ed102368c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1687127139&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=f6a84888a52e8a081a6e7ef2ead49c0a\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"41339134\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://ksr-qa-ugc.imgix.net/assets/041/339/134/ce549bc08438e49e85d34853c4ef5cd6_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;w=700&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1687127157&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=448a7bd7a8a7d2fc43b4e2e5bcc03667\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Once the Kickstarter is complete everything will ship from Fort Worth, Texas to all over the continental United States.

They bring years of experience in both editing and managing crowdfunding campaigns. The visuals presented in this campaign are still prototypes, and are likely to evolve in shape, number, color and contrast between now and the pledges' production phase. As mentioned in the FAQ, the development of Cyclades Legendary Edition, although well advanced, is still ongoing. We also worked very early on the development of the game, before the launch of the Cyclades campaign, in order to minimize the delay before the launch of production and shipping of your pledges. The experience gained from the successful edition of Northgard: Uncharted Lands comforts us with our ability to successfully and timely complete a project of this magnitude. This first campaign provided us with the necessary insight to deal with any potential setbacks inherent in any crowdfunding project. Our experience also allows us to anticipate certain potential points of friction in the smooth progress of production and the delivery of your pledges. However, the publication of a game of this caliber may encounter unforeseen circumstances beyond our control. If such a situation were to occur, we would promptly and transparently address it with you. We will do everything necessary to minimize the risks of setbacks and production delays. It is our utmost priority to provide our community with a high-quality product that meets their expectations in the shortest possible time. We are eagerly looking forward to seeing you play the game!",

The <strong>Director's cut</strong> by Bruno Cathala and <strong>Ludovic Maublanc</strong> combines the original game and its many expansions into a renewed, more epic, more thrilling gaming experience through an updated gameplay.</p>\n<p>Among the major changes :</p>\n<p><strong>⚙️3 game configurations</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A \"<strong>Classic</strong>\" mode for <strong>3 to 5</strong> players in which each player defends their own interests</li>\n  <li>A \"<strong>Teamplay</strong>\" mode for <strong>4 or 6</strong> players, offering the possibility to play as <strong>teams of 2</strong>, mixing cooperation between teammates and confrontation against opponents.</li>\n  <li>An enhanced and improved <strong>“2-players”</strong> mode<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>🗺️A <strong>modular game board</strong> is now built with landscape tiles assembled by the players during the setup of the game, allowing for<strong> everchanging maps</strong> and game strategies, bringing a constantly <strong>renewed </strong>gaming experience</p>\n<p>🙏<strong>6 gods</strong> instead of the 5 originals are now available, increasing players <strong>variety of actions</strong></p>\n<p>🛠️<strong>New free mandatory construction actions</strong> for the gods that considerably <strong>speed up </strong>the overall game time and the <strong>interaction </strong>between players</p>\n<p>⚔️<strong>Mercenaries</strong>, a <strong>new </strong>unit that comes with the new goddess: <strong>Hera</strong>, who enforces your troops during battles.</p>\n<p>🐍<strong>New Creatures and Heroes</strong> are now available in the base game and have been reworked to offer<strong> new strategic opportunities</strong> in building metropolises and gaining decisive advantages on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>💰<strong>Shorter </strong>and <strong>more dynamic bidding phases</strong> thanks to a new exponential bidding scale.</p>\n<p>🏙️The <strong>new

We are faced with large repair costs in addition to basic startup costs like coffee beans, paper products, inventory, starting capital for wages, rent, licensing costs, insurance, etc.</strong> </p>\n<p>Money raised from our kickstarter would go towards a gas stove, a mop sink installation, espresso machine installation, and various health code updates like flooring for our walk-in cooler and updated dish washing area. </p>\n<p><strong>Downtown Fargo has enough coffee shops. Moonrise Cafe is something different!</strong> We serve up custom cakes, unique pastries, and down-to-earth breakfast staples focused on local ingredients and creative flavors. A community room to rent for events, nonprofits, craft clubs, cake decorating classes, and more, can be expected.</p>\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"42179256\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/042/179/256/61c9277c6665c5b7231b5bb9a3df3658_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=oTqEudWAw275qQZin%2FOlqW32dGl05s99BFA4ZQyU3HQ%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"42179190\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/042/179/190/e84c42938ffc27ea0407bae8cce2da94_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=zqUoeMsvMm4lQwjTQZU5k5gEE4J70sbskTcYD6u44dE%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>We're excited to be neighbors to awesome local businesses like Replay Games, Little Brother, Silver Lining Creamery, and many more.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to be a destination for breakfast, lunch with friends, a quick coffee break, business meeting, or date. </p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption='Interior of cafe pre-redesign (consider this a \"before\" photo)' data-id=\"42100801\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/042/100/801/4528d024a91f8e4aca10ef264c09df45_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=XeytYZVreIaj6V60nf%2F8CwIDFEIM2Wk66lJtt1JCe5I%3D\">\n<figcaption class=\"px2\">Interior of cafe pre-redesign (consider this a \"before\" photo)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n",

We are confident in what we have designed, as they have had lots of real world hugging... errrr, “testing.”\n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing.\n\nAt the same time there is unforeseen issues that can delay production, or ruin entire batches of products.\n\nHowever, we have completed 6 successful Kickstarters and are working with established manufacturers with whom we have worked many times.\nWe've done everything we can to learn and adapt to changing times and even when we run into trouble, we always find a way to finish our projects.\n\nIn any case, we will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping. \n\nNo matter what, we will always ensure you get your pledge, even if it takes a bit longer.",

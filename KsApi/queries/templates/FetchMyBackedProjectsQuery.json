We have always had great interest in both golf and card games. Our grandparents introduced us to the card game \"Card Golf\" a couple years back, and we instantly loved it. However, after over a year of playing the game, we thought to ourselves - \"there must be a way to make card golf more competitive and play more like the actual game of golf.\" Thus, Card Golf Tour was born.  </strong></p><p><strong>Card Golf Tour improves on the traditional game of card golf by introducing: </strong></p><ul>\n<li><strong>A deck of playing cards that replicates a set of golf clubs.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>An innovative scoring system that allows players to score eagles, birdies, pars, and bogeys.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A unique par system that changes the duration of the hand.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>An optional proprietary stroke index system that varies the difficulty level from hand to hand.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Multiple game formats, including scramble, alternate shot, and match play.</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Our mission with Card Golf Tour is twofold; We want to help people learn about the game of golf while also creating a competitive and strategic card game that appeals to avid golfers and card players alike. We are running our Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the production of our first 100 units of Card Golf Tour.

Card Golf Tour is designed to be played with a group of 2-5 players and will take anywhere from 10-90 minutes based on the amount of hands you play. Listed is below is a brief guide to Card Golf Tour as well as an instructional video on our YouTube channel.</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Note-Composition-of-the-deck\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Note: Composition of the deck</strong></h4><p><strong>Each deck of Card Golf Tour playing cards includes 54 cards. There are 14 types of cards in the deck:</strong></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Putter (-5 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Driver (-2 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid (0 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1 Iron (1 point)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2 Iron (2 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>3 Iron (3 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>4 Iron (4 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>5 Iron (5 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>6 Iron (6 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>7 Iron (7 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>8 Iron (8 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>9 Iron (9 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pitching Wedge (10 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Sand Wedge (11 points)</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Each type of card has 4 cards in the deck, 2 green cards of the respective type and 2 black cards. The exception to this is the putter card, in which there are only two putters in the deck, one black putter and one green putter (think of the putter as the joker of a standard deck of playing cards).</strong></p><p><strong>In Card Golf Tour, the lower the point value of the card, the more valuable that card is. This means that the putter is typically the best card in the deck while the sand wedge is typically the worst card in the deck.</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Setup-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Setup:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- The dealer will shuffle the deck of cards and then deal. Each player will be dealt 4, 6, or 8 cards face down based on the par of the hole (dealer will reference the scorecard for the par of the hole). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- The dealer will then place the remaining cards in the the center of the table, forming the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile will then be turned over and placed next to the draw pile forming the discard pile. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Each player will arrange their cards in two horizontal rows of 2, 3, or 4 cards based on how many cards they were dealt. They will then chose 1, 2, or 3 cards to turn face up based on the amount of cards they were dealt. </strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Play-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Play:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- Each player will roll the dice to determine order of play. The lowest roll will be player 1, and the lowest dice roll between the player to the right and left of player 1 will be player 2. Play will then continue in this direction for the remainder of the hole. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- Through a series of drawing, matching, keeping, and discarding cards players will attempt to minimize their hands point total (see our instructional video attached below for further explanation of this facet of the game). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Once one player has all of their cards face up on the table, the hand ends and each remaining player is allowed one more turn. </strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Score-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Score:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- Each player will find the sum of their hand. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- Each player will then find the score to par that their hand total falls under (see our instructional video below for further information on the scoring system in Card Golf Tour). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Each player will then report their score on the hole to the scorekeeper who will keep a running tally of each players score throughout the round.</strong></p><p><strong>Note- Each step outlined above will be repeated for each subsequent hand in the game. It is recommended that the group plays either 9 or 18 hands, just like how golfers usually play 9 or 18 holes in a round.</strong></p><p><strong>At the conclusion of the game, the player with the lowest score is the winner!</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Instructional-Video-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Instructional Video:</strong></h4><div class=\"template oembed\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqyncJx4_7w&amp;t=217s\">\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h:What-Tour-Players-Are-Saying-\" class=\"page-anchor\">What <em>Tour</em> Players Are Saying...</h3><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43565382\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/565/382/19d8db0e683aabdacaa38991f74f992e_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=nsbjyTP0A6p8sklIon%2BQmNAuSyYFXv%2FwubrEQthOCvc%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43565383\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/565/383/fae24670ca5f24f32264af3623f69ff3_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=rp13w8EsSHlTzGS0hjHjUAWoHDEtF4Uy5V9aVyXTHcY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43649919\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/649/919/1fad42f0e34dee859cd2c6bebd5b2ff2_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=qTvayef%2F2Xb0hGGpDYROjqCXO%2BWltuh8dH28Ns6EikQ%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h:Stretch-Goals\" class=\"page-anchor\">Stretch Goals</h3><p><strong>At Card Golf Tour, we have decided not to use stretch goals as a part of our crowdfunding campaign. Our reasoning for this is simple.</strong></p><p><strong>We want to ensure that each backer who pledges to the campaign will be able to open their box and immediately begin playing Card Golf Tour. Some Kickstarter campaigns withhold certain components of their game and use them as a reward for a stretch goal. At Card Golf Tour, we have designed our game holistically so that no add-ons are necessary in order to play our game. While we have designed many different ways to play Card Golf Tour, we have decided that we will release these updates to the game at scheduled times throughout the upcoming year to keep the game feeling new and exciting. </strong></p><p><strong>Our team at Card Golf Tour is using our Kickstarter campaign as a proof of concept campaign. We do not intend to make a profit on our product using Kickstarter, but rather, want to use our campaign to spread awareness about our game. Card Golf Tour is a hobby for us, not a job.</strong></p><h3 id=\"h:Shipping\" class=\"page-anchor\">Shipping</h3><p><strong>Our team at Card Golf Tour has made the decision to only ship within the United States. Shipping will be $5 to anywhere within the U.S and no matter the pledge level. </strong></p><p><strong>Backers may notice that we have set March 2024 as our targeted delivery date for our product. This is an unusually short turnaround as our campaign will be ending on February 25th. The reason for this is that we have already produced our first 100 copies of Card Golf Tour. This means that once the campaign ends, assuming it has met its goal, we will be able to immediately begin the process of shipping out our game to backers. While we anticipate that shipping will take 1-2 weeks, we cannot guarantee anything and will make sure to provide continued updates as needed.</strong></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43738194\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/738/194/e3dd541b4f9566d12c139b7f4f707457_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=rL1B%2BaBj4PWcjvJMGE8kR6OOGIAmbKNy5RQy3nPTuiY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n",

In return, they often receive rewards such as early access to the product, exclusive merchandise, or other incentives based on the amount pledged. If the project successfully reaches or exceeds its funding goal by the campaign deadline, backers' pledges are collected, and the project creator uses the funds to bring their idea to fruition.",

Any pledge helps make our dream of bringing She Loves Me (Not) to peoples' homes a reality.</p><h4 id=\"h:2-0-Collection\" class=\"page-anchor\">2.0 - Collection</h4><p>Collection only occurs at the end of the campaign if we have successfully reached our funding goal. At that point, Kickstarter will collect the amount agreed to in your pledge. If we do not reach our funding goal then you will not be charged, but unfortunately you won't be receiving your copy of the game either.</p><h4 id=\"h:3-0-Pledge-Manager\" class=\"page-anchor\">3.0 - Pledge Manager</h4><p>Our 3rd party pledge manager will be opened up in April. This is where you have the opportunity to update your order, confirm shipping address, and pay for shipping.</p><h4 id=\"h:4-0-Updates\" class=\"page-anchor\">4.0 - Updates</h4><p>During the manufacturing process, we will provide updates to inform you with all the latest progress of our game. Expect updates to come out on a monthly basis at minimum, but we will also do our best to inform you as soon as we reach any major milestones or encounter any setbacks.</p><h4 id=\"h:5-0-Delivery\" class=\"page-anchor\">5.0 - Delivery</h4><p>The game goes through several hands as it makes its way from the manufacturer to your living room. We will continue to provide you updates during this time.</p><h4 id=\"h:6-0-Enjoy-\" class=\"page-anchor\">6.0 - Enjoy!</h4><p>Once your copy of She Loves Me (Not) arrives, it is time to gather your family and friends and share in a heartfelt laugh.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43658583\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Retailers\">Retailers</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/658/583/f47fe816bbd1e0e764882d8b938a3cad_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=lvQujWHX%2FV%2FcLXzEq%2Byeurq4H1cr6uGR1UN8pP0rBPY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>We love to support Friendly Local Game Stores and would be honored to see She Loves Me (Not) in your store soon.

Together We Go marries OSR adventure gaming that rewards clever choices over firing guns blazing and narrative mechanics that enhance shared storytelling. It's a system I fell in love with, recommend checking out, and made a few significant changes to facilitate faster combat and more heroic moments you'd expect when going into the cosmos to create planets.</p><p><strong>While keeping the spirit of encouraging players to traverse with care, players now auto-hit with every attack and often deal more damage when attacking.</strong> Skills are also bolstered so players are more capable of moving forward through the planet layer maps and hunting down bounties. PCs are now downed when they take Max Hits and die when they suffer Max+2 Hits.</p><p><strong>The trade off is rolling below an enemy's difficulty results in complications and put players at risk of counter attacks.</strong> The lethality remains with larger maps which offer more encounters, enemies with more health, and more opportunities for enemies to deal more damage during combat. More or less, Greenhorns is a game of glass cannons.</p><p><strong>The fantastic narrative elements from Together We Go are largely kept and slightly expanded to allow the crew to revel in their creations.</strong> The crew defines the loot they find and reflect on the parts of the planet they experienced after the planet creation missions are completed. Together, players define the records engraved in their loot that tell the stories of specific moments in the planet's history and foretell the planet's future events.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"Interior Spread.

The Great Machine is benevolent to all of its creations and does not interfere or aid Greenhorns on their missions. Diego illustrated several forms that the Creatora Machinika takes and they are all featured on this poster.</p><p>*To minimize shipping risks, prints are only available domestically in the US during the campaign. After the campaign we will be searching for solutions that provide international backers the opportunity to purchase posters at similar prices as the Kickstarter (including the third print if it is unlocked as a stretch goal).</p><p>**Please note that the posters are currently works-in-progress and will experience some upgrades before final printing. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43701690\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/701/690/ecd3262c3115f6599b2abb56c9dac5dc_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=OKBbQTC%2F3e1dbDbqzgulnph3KA9J7O02zZvqKsVzy1g%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"The Team\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43696881\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"The Team\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/696/881/a2d62320de5e68bf803eb130bf826442_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=t20gMC%2BwSZLdt6WPrXws70is8Rg84CmpOzlfKZUoF54%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p><strong>Marco Serrano</strong> (Game Design, Writing, Layout) runs Spicy Tuna RPG and had the pleasure of managing the development of Greenhorns.

studio is new to Kickstarter, but we are veterans of the industry and have been shipping games together for over 15 years. </p><p>This project began with a small team back in 2021 and we've been taking the time to experiment with different elements and flesh out the gameplay, characters and narrative ever since. We want to create an experience like nothing before and something meant to be enjoyed alongside your family or friends.</p><p>Our studio is completely independent and currently not able to finance a game like this entirely on our own. Last summer we put together a demo to show off some of the core controls we were happy with and ideally find a publishing partner. It was a little sad hearing how unpopular this genre is nowadays. We love co-op games, and don't think there are enough of them out there. </p><p>After Gamescom, we had to put the project on hold. Maybe permanently. Until we had the idea of sharing it with YOU, the players, to see if there was as much excitement about this type of game as we had. We absolutely adore this world we are creating and badly want to bring these characters to life. But we can't do it without you!</p><p>Please keep in mind this game is still in pre-production. There is still a lot of work to do and we want to ensure we can deliver something we are proud of and you will enjoy. We have a solid base planned for the amount with so much more if players are into it. </p><p>Also, all money from Kickstarter will go directly towards the production of the game and we will continue to invest our own funds into this as well. We are SO excited about this title and bringing this new world to life and we want to do it together with the community.</p><p>We will plan to release on PC and Console, starting with an Early Access hopefully later this year.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43504113\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/504/113/2cf2be03be11ed23720258c0682e717d_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=hfyzlGTzY5RbqXBRSoLl2YKgEBTDjethFxg38k1ILWw%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n",

We therefore do not have a very precise estimate of when the games will arrive in your homes, but we will do everything possible to respect the times we know from the company and to warn you of any possible changes. for the reasons mentioned above we have in fact pushed ourselves to produce only one main article so as to have a more manageable production, despite this any unforeseen event can happen, but it will be our responsibility to communicate everything to you promptly. For this reason, if you support us in realizing our dream of producing games that we like or if you are just interested in our project and have read up to this point, we would like to say THANK YOU in advance for believing in us. <3",

We’re confident in our ability to produce our product at quality in mass and fulfill all our perks on time. However, things don’t always go as planned. Here are a few of risks that MAY come up, and if so, our plan to address them:\n\nMANUFACTURING: We have a trusted manufacturer lined up and will have quality assurance people on site during production. Despite this, manufacturing delays can still happen. Whether it’s an unexpected backlog, bad timing with holidays, or a quality assurance issue on the ground floor, we’ll let you know immediately. Our #1 priority is product quality followed by timely delivery. \n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes, stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a package gets held up at customs, a shipment gets lost, or a global pandemic shuts down shipping ports around the world. Those things can cause delays. We are using an experienced logistics team to get our products to you. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.",

Teaching new players the the rules and tactics of backgammon is all part of the fun, but watch your back, because often times, even the most skilled players can be beat by newbies. Whether playing casually with friends or participating in competitive tournaments, backgammon remains <strong>a timeless game that continues to captivate players worldwide.</strong><img class=\"image\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/072/784/913e621ffc02048df03176e927e70cca_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=2063&amp;sig=gLXW7K4DS4c5kQw6p9NsgamfPYtIfzxzmHVWOhwWqxM%3D\" data-id=\"43072784\"></p><h4 id=\"h:Lightweight-\" class=\"page-anchor\">Lightweight.</h4><p>From the start, we recognized the importance of making GAMMN lightweight and travel friendly. After careful consideration, we settled on <strong>high impact polystyrene</strong> as our material choice, as it offers durability without adding any excessive weight. Weighing in at a grand total of <strong>2.35 pounds</strong>, the board is deceptively lightweight.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43563066\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit js-lazy-image\" data-src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/563/066/65b1986cf2a660556727375299108ba5_original.gif?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=xZTdi2oMBswE6djhy4ml1Y%2BkEAsmAHVfO88hyiBq2Ek%3D\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/563/066/65b1986cf2a660556727375299108ba5_original.gif?anim=false&amp;fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=AdlzUCqs1yMinipyhWVlvqmacPuWVf4IyqJnkNDLevU%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:Durable-\" class=\"page-anchor\">Durable.</h4><p>The construction of GAMMN is something we took very seriously. We wanted to make sure our boards would stand the test of time, as well as the elements. We leaned into injection molding as our manufacturing process, and after extensive testing, ultimately selected high impact polystyrene as the ideal board material. Additionally, GAMMN’s design features a <strong>water &amp; dust resistant seal</strong>, making it well-prepared for any adventure.

Not only is this an ode to the game’s history, but cork is a super <strong>renewable and sustainable material</strong>, too. Win-win.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43072793\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/072/793/d60dc7e432e0b599f0a87fe730dfdbaa_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=sEnX%2FU0lCSSZvmp7Jzg8blT6zcBuSbzCUeJR4I7phlM%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:Portable-\" class=\"page-anchor\">Portable.</h4><p>Adventure away from the kitchen table and explore new gameplay arenas.

They realized there was a gap in the market for a stylish, easy-to-use board that could travel anywhere, and just like that, GAMMN was born.</p><a href=\"http://launchboom.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43443752\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/443/752/9a70be1bb875bb23a98a48e5e83ff37e_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=TVxHW%2F2ckdur8rmpVtUKTOOd2NgjlXJ45r%2BujInW0hI%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a><a href=\"http://jellop.com/?utm_source=GAMMN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43443604\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit js-lazy-image\" data-src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/443/604/307d470266ba82957f827a73c8b0c123_original.gif?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=Dos9xtdCWOgbeOY4xTli0zzTbEELlPd74OlDmCrZ1Gs%3D\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/443/604/307d470266ba82957f827a73c8b0c123_original.gif?anim=false&amp;fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=QkXi4JAvzK7JrgkODmOse0cEowSM%2BijYh13UgAtsgYg%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"http://jellop.com/?utm_source=GAMMN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 3,500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $1B raised between them.</a></p>",

During the campaign, we will get another draft printed. Once that is good to go, we should be able to put the finishing touch on it and start shipping the book a few weeks after the campaign has ended. <strong>This is highly subject to change</strong> as there could still be errors in the physical copy, which will require another 2 weeks to get a draft sent to us.

                  "answer": "Absolutely! While the game was built for 1 Warden and 1 Adventurer, you've got a couple of options, some of which are covered inside Runecairn Wardensaga. If you have additional players that play once and awhile, you can use the summoning mechanic to summon a new hero into the world and fight alongside the adventurer. If the adventurer dies, the summoned ally disappears back to their world. You can also run this as an invasion, if your players enjoy PVP.\n\nAlternately, you can also run with a standard group of adventurers. I ran a group of 3 adventurers recently (video link here: https://youtu.be/l9xNXw9tnmw?si=i6FP3X1Q5b95Xmla) and had no issues.\n\nThe only sticky part is how to deal with death and bonfire respawning. The Warden might decide to say that if one adventurer dies, the remaining characters keep fighting and have the dead hero respawn after combat ends. Alternately, the adventurer could run back from the bonfire to attempt to rejoin the fight.\n\nThe beauty of Into the Odd and Cairn-based systems (like Runecairn) is they easily scale for multiple players.",

The statblocks presented in this manual, drawn from a multitude of global mythologies, are envisioned to enhance the diversity and depth of any fantasy world. This eclectic array mirrors the inherent blending of elements in many worlds and settings, where influences from various cultures and mythologies coexist harmoniously. For instance, a Cetus can prove to be a formidable foe in a naval adventure, while a Tengu could be a mysterious ally in an urban intrigue.<br><em>Mythological Creatures: A Monster Compendium for 5E </em>also provides a solid foundation for campaigns that wish to delve deeper into the realms of a specific mythology or even blend multiple mythologies. A campaign set in a world inspired by Greek mythology could have players embarking on odysseys akin to those of ancient heroes, facing creatures like the Minotaur or Medusa, while a campaign drawing from Hindu mythology could involve epic battles against Asuras and encounters with fierce Nagas. For a more comprehensive approach, Game Masters can craft a world where mythologies collide, creating a setting where a Norse Valkyrie might clash with the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, or where heroes need to unite forces from different pantheons to combat a universal threat, following an approach that does not only enrich the gaming experience, but also foster a deeper appreciation of the diverse mythologies that have shaped human storytelling.<br>In essence, our manual is designed to offer maximum flexibility and creative freedom, allowing Game Masters and players to explore and benefit from different myths and tales originating from a wide array of cultures and folklores.</p><h4 id=\"h:Book-Structure\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Book Structure</strong></h4><p>Spanning more than 350 pages, our compendium introduces a diverse and dynamic collection of over 300 statblocks from legends. This book is a treasure trove for enthusiasts and Game Masters alike, divided into six distinct sections, each detailing monsters and myths from various parts of the world. The sections are divided as follows:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<strong>American Mythology</strong>, which includes mythologies and traditions from Aztec, Maya, Inca, Native American and Southern American;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Asian Mythology</strong>, encompassing Japanese, Chinese, Hindu, and various other traditions across the entirety of the Asian continent;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Egyptian Mythology</strong>;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Greek Mythology</strong>;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Norse Mythology</strong>;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other Mythologies</strong>, featuring creatures from a variety of other cultures from all around the world.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43754635\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/754/635/e720e1f5f44371cc47ff3b804fda4f3c_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=yuxKGvNkWH2kHKvaD7EfXn9D1JyJnoeO9H9Xw7Iz3FU%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Each section delves into the captivating world of its respective tradition(s), featuring a dedicated segment that offers a broad overview of their histories and customs, including pantheons and other intriguing details.</p><h4 id=\"h:Mythic-Heroes\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Mythic Heroes</strong></h4><p>Each mythology is further enriched with a scalable mythic hero, an iconic figure pivotal to their respective mythos. For instance, in the Greek section, readers will encounter an Olympian hero, while the Asian section features a martial cultivator. These figures are presented with three distinct statblocks each - one at CR5, CR10, and CR15 - and equipped with a vast selection of additional custom traits that can also be applied to other creatures.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43754731\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/754/731/b6a85966999c0edbaebae92ddbccba30_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=4p9QswkPV%2Fj38WCnoRnrAolH29w1rltwYM4fPTfqbTw%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Through these traits, you can possibly adapt each statblock to reflect a specific hero from legends. For instance, an Olympian hero could be customized to represent Hercules, with enhanced strength and combat skills; Ulysses, known for his cunning and strategic mind; or Achilles, renowned for his unparalleled prowess in battle. The multitude of traits opens up a wide array of options, allowing Game Masters to create a diverse range of legendary heroes (or villains) in unique and imaginative ways.</p><h4 id=\"h:Unique-Encounters\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Unique Encounters</strong></h4><p>In addition to the statblocks, each creature is brought to life with a detailed entry describing its lore, often accompanied by fascinating legends that surround it. While the mythological aspect forms an integral part of this compendium, it serves primarily as an inspirational backdrop to the diverse creatures within. Our manual has been thoughtfully designed to cater to a wide range of campaigns and play styles, offering a substantial selection of Challenge Ratings (CRs) suitable for both gritty and epic adventures. To add an element of surprise and variability in encounters, we've included numerous additional variant traits, ensuring that even repeated encounters with the same creature remain fresh and challenging.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43755105\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/755/105/8eb2871739b8acc8b92e6e53d97e6576_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=sGOoX687ygSKJeiS6rzzyGXC6MzTf%2B3PN0399EqBeI8%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:Multiphased-Bossfights\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Multiphased Bossfights</strong></h4><p>Significantly, many creatures in this manual feature a unique second phase: the Mythological Phase, briefly detailed in the following sections.

It's in this spirit that we crafted this manual, dedicated to adapting the rich and varied mythological creatures from various cultures into the 5E format. Our decision to focus on mythology stems from its undeniable significance in shaping human thought, art, and culture across the centuries. Mythological tales, with their pantheon of gods, heroic mortals, and mythic beasts, have always been an important tool not only to provide entertainment, but also impart moral lessons, explain natural phenomena, and offer insight into the human condition.<br>While many 5E settings already incorporate elements inspired by mythology, we noticed that many aspects and creatures from these traditions often remain unexplored or underrepresented in the game's content. Recognizing this gap, we felt compelled to create a manual that not only fills this void but also expands the scope of what mythological elements can offer to any campaign world. By integrating these mythical beings into the game, we aim to offer players and Game Masters alike a chance to experience the awe, wonder, and moral complexity that these stories encapsulated for our ancestors, now retooled for epic adventures and unforgettable campaign narratives. Our commitment to this theme is not a one-off endeavor; we envision creating more manuals in the future that continue to explore the uncharted territories of mythology within the 5E framework and beyond, bringing a wealth of new content, inspirations, and challenges to tables around the world.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43709987\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/709/987/a6415fb191e7b1a0be16976434fe1001_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=d9WM92R%2BY6Dx6SclKC%2BCDzSLJZJVR76Sv40wwwSVljU%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43657932\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/657/932/e9bc9d782e8537f4d7b8f3d01aee3fea_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=tomhpX9RwvWyZE8fMrlDqyrwsnsvsJoLPeZwpscQupQ%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43649576\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Mythological-Phase\">Mythological Phase</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/649/576/05f7a620d9d85185cf60f78baa820e14_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=mfvk4WQxQRaAbPOcpHt0NXNgUx%2FxfJL%2B8FAZehlLics%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>A Mythological Phase is an optional second phase of combat that can be triggered under specific circumstances. This phase is designed to showcase the true, often hidden, might of legendary creatures, plunging players into an even more challenging and memorable combat scenario. The creature may receive various benefits, increasing its resilience, speed, or strength, further elevating the challenge it poses to the adventurers.</p><p>The Mythological Phase is triggered when a creature with a <strong>Mythological Trait</strong> is reduced under a certain hit points threshold, revealing the true depth of the creature's mythical nature and presenting unique challenges and strategies for players to encounter. We envisioned two different types of Mythological Phases, depending on the creature's type and the level of challenge Game Masters wish to create for their players: the <strong>Mythological Awakening</strong> and the <strong>Mythological Empowerment</strong>.</p><p>Mythological Phases are designed to transform encounters with mythological creatures into potentially deadly battles that require strategic thinking and resourcefulness. These phases are inherently difficult and are intended to test the limits of player characters in combat. They are particularly well-suited for groups that thrive on challenging combat scenarios, adding complexity and unpredictability that can make battles more engaging and memorable. Additionally, these phases offer versatility in scaling creatures to match the power level of player characters. By applying this mechanic to lower-level creatures, Game Masters can scale their threat to match more powerful adventurers, ensuring that even familiar foes can provide a new challenge.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43657381\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/657/381/e9bc9d782e8537f4d7b8f3d01aee3fea_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=lVkXDVfYLh9nWgu8RU%2FzYv681RzgMEO%2FbQoIWBLjGEA%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43669246\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Pledge-Tiers\">Pledge Tiers</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/669/246/a8fadfc88e4d6fb05a5bab9509a7355a_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=vFGlW%2BjUG5%2FTQXc0i7ZLEOFYKlfgxfFvoquM%2BzRcrfI%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:PDF-24-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>PDF - 24€</strong></h4><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43709408\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/709/408/9ff34c468140b5536fa1eeea7cd2d880_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=9M7m3sRdI%2FO5E3wbZnv6AwML7u9cvWv5Z6cP2ToiiBo%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>This tier includes the PDF of Mythological Creatures, including any stretch goal unlocked during the campaign.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43710385\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/710/385/4fc50703a8fbab46f613409126a1b0b9_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=TosSLXGF%2BIbjjCm%2FW3yv4JH7bAesP2ymAtheEnEcu7w%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:PDF-VTT-Tokens-29-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>PDF + VTT Tokens 29€</strong></h4><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43709530\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/709/530/eab3e5041fd81a381058040f9cceaf05_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=dvXDcuRWiYsdq4Yl0N0IfdCJ8FldHaKiQORNTY%2FomNs%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>This tier includes the PDF of Mythological Creatures, plus VTT-ready tokens for all the creatures included in the manual (for a total of 200+ tokens with a custom token border).</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43710388\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/710/388/4fc50703a8fbab46f613409126a1b0b9_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=35JIqwLldkwbW55gzDe2mNs4wGA3HSn9FN7u6bnvJUY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:Exclusive-Backer-Digital-Version-34-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Exclusive Backer (Digital Version) - 34€</strong></h4><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43709539\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/709/539/ab437970e4c88656ee160697a9932e20_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=qp8VjiOqABxjIL2RboXhTGwfVF3NmxMnLEa4SqFKMyI%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>All previous tier rewards plus your name in the Credits section of the manual.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43710389\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/710/389/4fc50703a8fbab46f613409126a1b0b9_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=42DG%2Fu2e6wbtc%2FQ4iHp%2FnL3%2FfwBOHplGmcW4JsLrcb0%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h:PDF-Hardcover-59-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>PDF + Hardcover - 59€</strong></h4><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43709571\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/709/571/317f409461e25566171bf9f6ff549699_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=NzKON66Lcrtp2pcmVEUwY6uXKceVlA%2FNVlX2%2FE0MIB0%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>This tier includes all the previous rewards, plus the Hardcover version of our manual!

Our story is one of friendship, creativity, and a shared journey through the vast and imaginative landscapes of TTRPGs. Our paths crossed years ago, initially as fellow players, taking turns in the roles of Game Master and player. This experience laid the foundation for a deep, collaborative friendship, one where our strengths as storytellers and GMs complemented each other perfectly.</p><p>Today, as DMSlash and JonnyDM, we founded Mythos Chronicles, dedicated to creating and sharing content that enhances and celebrates the TTRPG experience. We believe in the transformative power of storytelling and the unique magic that collaborative creativity brings to the gaming table. Our goal is to craft content that not only sparks the imagination but also strengthens the bonds within the 5E community.</p><p>Throughout our journey, we have honed our craft and emerged as bestselling authors for 5E, publishing on diverse platforms such as DMsGuild, DrivethruRPG, and Patreon. This Kickstarter project marks our first venture into crowdfunding, but it stands on a solid foundation of experience and a proven track record in creating engaging and beloved content for this amazing game.</p><p>If you wish, you can check out our adventures and past projects on Instagram:</p><p><strong>Luigi Caterino (DMSlash):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dungeonmasterslash/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@dungeonmasterslash</a><br><strong>Filippo Bardoscia (JonnyDM):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jonnydmandgames/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@jonnydmandgames</a></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43710554\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/710/554/e9bc9d782e8537f4d7b8f3d01aee3fea_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=JZTwANWHLq56pmaT7Ei1fRULMstumYy9ui2FZ%2BN9U%2Bg%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43649862\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Acknowledgements-and-Credits\">Acknowledgements and Credits</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/649/862/3da688deeff6a2970671f0482c87c2e7_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=o5oafPj0lRorNZTHrGU4QyDN3FG28mLQ7u25auJkIac%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>As we bring the mythic odyssey of <em>Mythological Creatures </em>to life, we extend our deepest gratitude to those who have joined us on this remarkable journey.</p><ul>\n<li>A special thanks to Alberto Mazzotta [<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/low_track/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@low_track</a>] for their exceptional video editing skills and keen eye for detail.</li>\n<li>We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Luigi Astengo [<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/luigi.astengo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@luigi.astengo</a>] and their formidable voice acting that brought a new depth to the trailer for our project.</li>\n<li>To our fans and followers, your unwavering enthusiasm and support have been the wind beneath our wings.

Our company has done this before many times and we have done it exceptionally well.\n\nThis project is managed by creatives and entrepreneurs who have many years of experience with the hobby gaming industry. Additionally, the game design, writing, and graphic production for all products is complete. Consequently, with our extensive planning and management protocols in place, we believe that the risks and challenges are minimal for this project.\n\nThat said, the world is still experiencing the tail end of unprecedented supply chain issues that are impacting the hobby game industry. Unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and ongoing freight issues may consequently result in some shipping delays (as they have in the past). We have built extra room into our announced release date to accommodate this, but we may have underestimated the lingering global situation.\n\nAs always, our goal is to ensure our Kickstarter backers are the first to receive their pledged game rewards. We will post campaign updates regularly from the end of the Kickstarter until we have fulfilled your pledges. After the campaign, we offer a refund on your physical pledge (minus the non-refundable Kickstarter and payment processing fees that we cannot recover). Digital-only rewards are non-refundable once the PDF download codes have been issued. If PDFs codes have already been sent to backers, but physical rewards have not, any requested refund of physical rewards will be reduced by the market price of the PDF rewards that were previously sent. Refunds are either processed via PayPal or through an alternate convenient method, at our discretion. Should you have questions about this Kickstarter's refund policy, please email info@dyskami.ca for clarification.",

The next season of Rogue Angel starts in three weeks.” Monad CEO Louise Carrel’s lips quirked, the first show of emotion. “Don’t tell me something happened. You promised  that transferring AI between systems posed no risk.”</em></p>\n<p><em>The pressure in his gut relaxed a fraction. She didn’t know. He still had time to set things right. Still had a chance to pretend the entire Ikarion Gate episode had never happened. Still had a chance to pretend the virtuoid hadn’t slipped off to another—quite real—realm of the Multiverse. All he had to do was find a way to do the impossible: reach a hand across the Multiverse, to the realm of Ikaris, and retrieve the Rogue Angel back to Ikarion and the Nexus. </em></p>\n<p><em>“Of course. I’ll look into it. Right away. Is there anything else?” he asked.</em></p>\n<p><em>“That’ll be all. I don’t want to hear from that Omniverse exec again, you understand? Get it done.” The transmission terminated. </em></p>\n<p><em>With an explosive sigh, he sagged back. Ikarion was modeled after his grandfather’s diary entries on Ikaris, which until recently he’d considered to be a work of fiction. With the Ikarion Gate now gone, he was at a loss for how to retrieve the Rogue Angel. The clock was ticking and he had less than three weeks to do the impossible.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Ikarion Quest</strong> is an isekai LitRPG adventure novel – Book Two in the Ikarion trilogy, following <strong>Ikarion Gate</strong> – that unfolds in BESM's Anime Multiverse setting. What's a LitRPG, you ask? Here's the (edited) entry from the Wikipedia page:</p>\n<p><em>\"LitRPG, short for literary role playing game, is a literary genre combining the conventions of computer RPGs with science-fiction and fantasy novels. In LitRPG, games or game-like challenges form an essential part of the story, and visible RPG statistics (for example Body, Mind, and Soul) are a significant part of the reading experience. This distinguishes the genre from novels that tie in with a game, like those set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons; books that are actual games, such as the choose-your-own-path Fighting Fantasy type of publication; or games that are literally described, like MUDs and interactive fiction. Typically, the main character in a LitRPG novel is consciously interacting with the game or game-like world and attempting to progress within it.\"</em></p>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43482995\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/482/995/495b15615f365dceec2d381d87e1fd16_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=e6sAFs9wleJ9XRpXz3lHXqcULEcKqFgS7YxK07yVomA%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Ikarion Quest</strong> continues the exploits of Tito, an anonymous Imago slummer who was mysteriously transported through the Ikarion VR MMO game into the real fantasy world of Ikaris as his alter ego identity, Card the Hedge Merchant.

This means <strong>you'll have your copies between several weeks and a few months before they are available in stores!</strong> </li>\n<li>Finally, funds from pledges like yours that push the campaign above the minimum threshold <strong>advance work on the</strong> <strong>BESM game line</strong>. This means we can reprioritise our work schedule, and allocate more resources towards creating and improving amazing future products at Dyskami. Your pledge here tells us that you want to see more multi-genre anime RPG releases from us.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43482956\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/482/956/c3258736e505d2586ee463395ed098db_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=k%2BHdP4nWuQ8hzYNXg665DNaSLNHJI1V69%2FkVO3%2FIJbw%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n\n<p>This direct-to-consumers campaign is a vital component for expanding the <strong>BESM RPG </strong>line and distributing it worldwide.

            "story": "<p>Philadelphia natives and former Sire recording artists Riverside are known for their dreamy, often melancholy rock, heavy on jangling guitars, shimmering and emotional tunes. Their debut One was a hit with critics and fans alike, with its ringing guitars and British-influenced tones, reminiscent of bands like Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and The Smiths. They also had a strong affinity with another area band The Ocean Blue (whose keyboardist Steve Lau produced One). Their songs \"Cinnamon Eyes\" and \"Waterfall\" were staples on college radio and MTV.</p><div class=\"template oembed\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8P8JgTbSms\">\n<iframe width=\"267\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8P8JgTbSms?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Riverside - Cinnamon Eyes (Video)\"></iframe>\n\n</div>\n<p>With recent sold-out shows with The Ocean Blue, and growing fan excitement, it's the right time to bring this album back to the world in the format it deserves. Rising vinyl production costs and the intricacies of licensing from Warner Bros. make this a unique undertaking, so we're asking for your help to make this happen!</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43617748\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/617/748/ca9896b1068cc55f28b6835d0f124ecf_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=G%2B1SjECesqz0%2BZkMS%2BpvARWiKZYu%2B%2B9kqLEPi7i4NVg%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>We anticipate costs to be around $17,000 to break even on this project. We at Lost in Ohio promise to deliver the highest possible quality sound and artwork (no fuzzy blown-up CD art here!). We are working on some details that we're pretty excited to share when the time comes, and we'll take you along for the ride with regular updates.</p><p>It wouldn't be Kickstarter without bundles, and there is something for everyone here. Vinyl is available in two limited edition variants: Waterfall Blue and Galaxie Yellow (mockups of each pictured above). We will also do a limited run of t-shirts and posters for you to snag (designs still in progress, but we'll share when they're done). The band has even found a hidden stash of CDs of their sophomore release <em>Taste</em> which you can add onto any order.</p><p>We are working toward a release date of late summer, and think this is very achievable. Our label has delivered several vinyl releases of the past few years, and we will be working with proven partners for vinyl mastering, lacquers and pressing.</p><h4 id=\"h:International-Customers-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>International Customers:</strong></h4><p>As you may know, international shipping costs tend to fluctuate more rapidly than domestic shipping, and can even vary by country. For this reason, we will collect shipping for all international orders when we have product in hand. When we are ready to ship, <strong>you will receive a separate invoice for the exact shipping costs, which must be paid before we can deliver your order!</strong> We work with a proven shipping partner that will ensure we can get the lowest-possible price. (If you have questions, or want a rough estimate of shipping costs to your country, send us a message!)</p>",

They're all American based so any issues with their supply chains would be the only obstacles in getting these products. \n\nAnd I've targeted April for the fullfilment of all orders to allow ample time to get all orders processed and mailed out. \n\nAs usual, I always keep everyone updated via social media posts, but will use the Kickstarter email messaging center for any pertinent updates.",

Their mission is twofold: to recover the lost relics of Osiris, the god of the afterlife and resurrection, scattered across enigmatic pyramids, and to find the Eye of Horus, a legendary artifact rumored to grant foresight and protection.</p><p>The adventure unfolds in a series of acts, each presenting unique challenges and decisions. In the first act, the party learns about the fragmented relics of Osiris. Their quest leads them through multiple pyramids, each guarded by followers of Set, the god of chaos and disorder. The adventurers face intricate puzzles that test their wit and wisdom, reflecting Osiris's domain over life and death, as well as Set's chaotic influence. As they journey from pyramid to pyramid, they must contend with Set's minions, creatures embodying chaos and destruction.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43349600\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/349/600/9ad74bd6b3e8772e4068b71a6c80dde8_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=Fnb4KGY%2FGtKjm%2FP7lelAt8e89aiKqEQLod91y5tcfs8%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>The labyrinth of the Eye of Horus forms the crux of the second act. Hidden within a labyrinthine pyramid, the Eye is also sought by two rival factions: The Order of the Golden Falcon, an ancient society advocating for strict governance, and The Keepers of the Eternal Balance, a group of scholars and mages dedicated to maintaining the balance between order and chaos. High Commander Anupenkau and Priestess Ketet lead the Order, seeking the Eye to solidify their control, while Master Sebek and Lady Ta-pera from the Keepers aim to safeguard the Eye from misuse. The adventurers must navigate this labyrinth, facing mythical creatures from Egyptian lore, with each encounter bringing them closer to the Eye and forcing them to weigh the moral implications of their decisions.</p><p>The final act, The Convergence, sees the adventurers with the relics of Osiris and the Eye of Horus in hand, facing a momentous decision. They can use the relics to resurrect Osiris, potentially restoring balance but risking unknown consequences, or they can prevent his return, thus maintaining the status quo but possibly allowing Set's influence to grow. This act culminates in a grand confrontation, where the adventurers' choices shape the future of the land and affect the balance between mortals and deities.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43349614\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/349/614/588a649ce25d8d1ecefa6a5a4b9d6787_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=dM9afS0Z5zIhTMBaA9fxkeXTTpOJa15xoQreSerFopI%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Throughout their journey, the adventurers encounter many monsters steeped in Egyptian mythology. From undead guardians wrapped in ancient linens to jackal-headed humanoids serving Anubis, each monster presents a unique challenge. Sphinxes pose enigmatic riddles, while scorpionfolk and crocodile-headed warriors engage in combat. The depths of the pyramids are home to fire scorpions and necrotic vipers, and the adventurers must also contend with animated cursed statues and swarms of flesh-eating scarabs.</p><p>\"Pyramids of Power: The Resurrection Gamble\" is not just a quest for powerful artifacts but also a deep exploration of ancient mythology, moral dilemmas, and the consequences of meddling in the affairs of gods. The adventurers' journey through this mythical world is a test of their courage, wisdom, and morality.</p><h3 id=\"h:Mysteries-of-Myth-and-Machine\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Mysteries of Myth and Machine</strong></h3><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43349269\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/349/269/970eb116f8b42f5d336d89fa282322cb_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=q8062BIOVreoZBgngZHW%2BZhJfoqnXO4FqZLvuV0ysHo%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>\"Mysteries of Myth and Machine\" is a premium print hardcover collection that brings together three riveting Penny Blood Adventures, each offering a unique and immersive experience.

            "risks": "This is my first-ever Kickstarter campaign. I discovered Kickstarter many years ago, long before Hockey Hardware. I knew back then that Kickstarter was a popular crowdfunding platform for creators to fund their creations. I also knew it was also a platform that I wanted to use if I ever became a creator and needed to crowdfund a project.\n\nSoon after I began creating Hockey Hardware in late 2018, I took a deeper dive into learning more about Kickstarter. That's when I realized this campaign would be a very fun but serious undertaking. I also realized there was a lot of planning, research, and considerations that needed to go into building a Kickstarter campaign that would give Hockey Hardware its best chance of success. I was up for the challenge, and got to work.\n\nMany aspects of this creative journey have taken me out of my comfort zone. Often, I have come into scenarios feeling vulnerable and insecure about my lack of knowledge or experience on certain subjects, like graphic design, packaging products, and shipping. But those feelings are good motivation to keep going and learn something new. Learning and discovery is a life-long process, and often, it's unpredictable, time consuming, costly, and can involve a lot of trial and error.\n\nThroughout this Kickstarter journey, I have also met so many fantastic and friendly people, who have been exceptionally helpful and supportive. Hockey Hardware and this Kickstarter campaign has also given me a great reason to reconnect with old friends and distant family, who I've lost touch with over the years.\n\nWhile many risks and challenges of this project are foreseeable and within my control, many are not. As a creator, I have to do my best to identify risks and challenges as early as possible, so these can be navigated and mitigated the best I can. It's also important to build-in flexibility and contingency into my planning, costs, and funding goal, so that there's a bit of a cushion for any unwanted surprises.\n\nOne early concern I had in this project was intellectual property protection. That's why I invested in getting Hockey Hardware registered as a trademark in both Canada and the US as soon as I felt confident that 'Hockey Hardware' was going to be my game's name. I also secured the copyright protection for the game.\n\nAnother early challenge was the costs of graphic design. Early on, I was paying for graphic design but I soon realized my graphic needs were far too great, and I simply could not afford to continue this approach. So, I decided to learn graphic design instead. It was like learning a new language, and YouTube was my teacher. \n\nToday, I have gained this transferable skill and I am knowledgeable in different graphic design programs. Learning how to do graphic design also saved me a lot of money that I invested into other areas of my project; it has given me far greater control over my projects; and I can carry these graphic design skills forward with me in future projects.\n\nMuch of the same can be said about designing and managing Hockey Hardware's website, www.HockeyHardware.com. Before undertaking this project, I had no idea how to design or build or run a website on the WIX platform. But now I do, and it's very liberating to learn these new skills. It also gives me greater control over my work, and helps reduce costs, so I can invest those funds into other areas.\n\nAnother risk that I've identified was the vulnerability and fragility of global supply chains in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. After experiencing the unreliability and insecurity of some supply chains as a consumer during this time, I realized it was another reason to source from North American suppliers and manufacturers whenever possible.\n\nThese are just some of the risks and challenges I've experienced so far in my entrepreneurial journey, and I am certain there will be many more ahead. Hopefully, scaling up is one of them, if this campaign is tremendously successful.\n\nLearning is a life-long process, and mistakes are always going to be made. With that said, every creator and their projects are subject to their own unique sets of risks and challenges. As creators, how and when we identify, respond, prevent, mitigate, and resolve these risks and challenges is key for increasing the chances of our project's success.",

The evening was getting late, and I was getting ready for bed. As part of my nightly routine, I was on my phone, checking to see how my fantasy hockey team was doing that night. </p><p>Suddenly, the idea hit me: the world has been missing a fantasy hockey inspired tabletop game. </p><p>Any plans to sleep that night were immediately iced, as I got to work right away on scribbling down my concept.</p><p>Five years later, after countless hours of research, learning, designing, play testing, and development, <em>Hockey Hardware</em>®<em>: The Original Game </em>is in its final prototype stage, and ready for its Kickstarter debut!</p><p>Inspired by my passion for hockey, fantasy sports, and games, Hockey Hardware is a card and dice tabletop game that combines all three interests.</p><p>Play testers have described it as 'fun', 'interactive', and 'competitive', and it takes a mix of both good luck and strategy to win. </p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43326061\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/326/061/e2dd881adc4a8e885ff81d978ba9afce_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=1AAprnWXt%2FOQ%2BaDGpE39Ytbu7jpEBpd5TsOvSiQBDOY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Appropriate for ages eight and above, Hockey Hardware plays between two and four players, while typically taking anywhere between 45 minutes and two hours to play - depending on the number of players playing and their familiarity with the game.</p><p>Hockey Hardware was made for the hockey fan and game enthusiast, but anyone can quickly learn how to play, have fun, and win. No previous hockey knowledge or experience is needed.</p><p>Considering this, I believe there is a greater role for Hockey Hardware than simply being a tabletop game. I strongly support the notion that hockey is for everyone, and I believe that Hockey Hardware can help bridge gaps to accessing hockey. Beyond being a source of fun and entertainment, I believe Hockey Hardware has the ability to create new fans, which would grow the sport we love in Canada, the US, and beyond.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"40931540\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Objective\">Objective</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/040/931/540/3f58e4a9536a9f3e0140caf6bac99425_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=3K85O4bZlvSvHjQEwdyejR264%2Fak4r8HVEYB%2FfQ9FY0%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>The objective of Hockey Hardware is to win the Champion’s Cup by having the most Trophy Cards at the end of the Third Period.

Each Period has five Rounds before there's an Intermission.</p><p>At the start of the game, every player creates their Player Profile by determining their Conference, Position, and Roster Level. A player's Conference can start as either East or West, and their Position and Roster Level can start as either Forward Line 2 or Defence Pair 2.</p><p>A player's Conference, Position, and Roster Level can change multiple times throughout the game. These changes can impact which Trophy Cards they can compete for, and their ability to collect Hockey Stats. For example, the higher the Roster Level, the more Stat Dice a player can roll, and the more Hockey Stats they can collect; whereas the lower their Roster Level, the fewer Stat Dice they can roll, resulting in less Hockey Stats being collected.</p><p>Each player's turn consists of three stages: 1.

While I have spearheaded this project to this point, it's going to take a big team effort to reach its funding goal, and bring it to life. Widespread promotion helps give this campaign its best chance of success.</p><p>Hockey Hardware promotional efforts began in the Fall of 2023. That's when I started publishing content on Hockey Hardware's social media platforms. These platforms include Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, and YouTube. Please Like, Follow, Subscribe, and Share Hockey Hardware content on these platforms if you aren't already!</p><p>Throughout this crowdfunding campaign, I have planned to host and attend various hockey and game-related events to help promote Hockey Hardware and raise awareness about its Kickstarter. While this serious undertaking is a lot of hard work and countless hours, it's important to have fun with it, too. Otherwise, what's the point?! I've always been a believer in the mantra of 'work hard, play hard'.</p><p>Some of Hockey Hardware's most notable planned Kickstarter events include: </p><ul>\n<li>Hosting a Hockey Hardware Kickstarter Launch Party in Ottawa at Level One Game Pub on January 17; </li>\n<li>Attending the 2024 Frosty Mug Alumni Event at the Sleeman Centre in Guelph on January 18; </li>\n<li>Hosting a Hockey Hardware Kickstarter Party in Niagara at Ludology Boardgame Cafe in St. Catharines on January 22; </li>\n<li>Partnering with and attending The Carnegie Initiative Summit 2024 in Toronto;</li>\n<li>Attending various events in Toronto during the 2024 NHL All-Star Weekend, including the NHL Fan Fair and NHL All-Star Thursday, which features the All-Star Player Draft, a ceremony to honour the 1967 Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) 3-on-3 Showcase.</li>\n<li>Hosting multiple game nights in Ottawa; and more!</li>\n</ul><p>In addition, Hockey Hardware will also be promoted through paid-advertising on social media, while trying to create, discover, and leverage additional opportunities to score earned media across different mediums, too.</p><p>You can help Hockey Hardware reach its funding goal by making a pledge, by sharing this campaign with your family, friends, and social media, and by encouraging others to make a pledge to Hockey Hardware as well. It truly takes a village. Or in this case, a team, to turn this dream into a reality and make it come true. After all, teamwork makes the dream work.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43316851\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Funding-Goal\">Funding Goal</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/316/851/d6296e69eaf8c47c0ba57a10cc9d72de_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=rFxxhSCN%2FKl5%2BmeW0szXlz9CF266SHuNzd7fK6J12ZU%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>The mission of this Kickstarter campaign is to bring Hockey Hardware to life. Your pledge will help Hockey Hardware get closer to achieving its mission objective, and hopefully, accomplishing it.</p><p>The funding goal of this campaign covers the costs of:</p><ul>\n<li>manufacturing Hockey Hardware;</li>\n<li>procuring Rewards and Add-on items;</li>\n<li>storage, fulfillment, and packaging items;</li>\n<li>shipping items to Backers in Canada and the US; and,</li>\n<li>taxes and fees.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>MANUFACTURING THE GAME AND PROCURING REWARDS AND ADD-ONS</strong><br>From the very beginning of creating Hockey Hardware, I have always placed an emphasis on doing my best to source components, materials, services, and items from North America. I believe in supporting North American jobs, businesses, and our economy as much as possible, whenever possible.</p><p>To make this campaign more fun, interesting, and entertaining, I am offering a wide variety of Reward Tiers and Add-ons that Backers can choose from, including physical items, experiences, and digital options. Through a lot of research, I have found North American suppliers and manufacturers for the following physical items, who I intend to source from after the campaign successfully funds:</p><ul>\n<li>The medallions, plaque, and glass award are sourced from a company in Winnipeg, Manitoba; </li>\n<li>The hockey pucks are sourced from a company in Bolton, Ontario; </li>\n<li>The hockey jerseys are made by a company in St. Catharines, Ontario;</li>\n<li>Early game prototypes were made by a company in Madison, Wisconsin; and, </li>\n<li>Hockey Hardware games resulting from this Kickstarter campaign will be made by a domestic manufacturer in Montréal, Québec.</li>\n</ul><p>The only major component in Hockey Hardware that will be imported are the custom-designed dice. After significant research, time, costs, and comparing prototypes, I decided the best manufacturer of dice at this time is from a company overseas, which I was referred to by a Canadian business owner who sells dice in Kitchener, Ontario. To be clear, this Kitchener business only <em>sells</em> dice, they do not <em>manufacture</em> them.</p><p><strong>STORAGE</strong><br>My wife and I rent a small apartment unit, so we don't have enough space at home to store items and fulfill pledges. To complete these essential tasks, we'll need to rent some extra space at a nearby facility in Ottawa.</p><p><strong>PACKAGING</strong><br>A lot of time, thought, and experimentation has gone into the packaging strategy. I intend to use more paper than plastics in my packaging because paper products can be easily recycled and reused, and they breakdown more quickly. I have also carefully considered the size and weight of my Reward Tiers and Add-ons to improve their packaging efficiencies, both to reduce waste and save costs.</p><p><strong>SHIPPING</strong><br>For domestic shipping within Canada, most Reward Tiers and Add-ons will ship in a flat rate box from Canada Post. These flat rate boxes come with many benefits, including tracking; up to $100 of liability coverage for loss or damage; guaranteed on-time delivery in Canada; and they are environmentally friendly.</p><p>For shipping to the US, most Reward Tiers and Add-ons will be packed into corrugated boxes, and then shipped through Canada Post or a different shipping service. Items that don't need boxes will be shipped in envelopes and bubble mailers. Once shipped, most items will have a tracking number, and should arrive at their intended destination within 8 business days.</p><p>While most items should ship into the US duty-free, if any import, duty fees, or taxes are charged, it will be the responsibility of the receiver to pay for them upon the item being delivered to them.</p><p><strong>FEES</strong><br>After the funding goal is achieved, Kickstarter fees will cost 5% of the total funds raised and the payment processor will also take between 3-5%. I have budgeted for 4%.</p><p><strong>TOTAL FUNDING GOAL BREAKDOWN (from highest to lowest expense):</strong></p><ul>\n<li>   $65,000 - Manufacturing Hockey Hardware</li>\n<li>+ $31,000 - Packaging, Fulfillment &amp; Shipping</li>\n<li>+ $11,500 - Kickstarter and Payment Processor Fees</li>\n<li>+ $10,000 - Procuring Rewards and Add-ons</li>\n<li>+ $5,000 - Storage</li>\n<li>+ $2,500 - Contingency</li>\n<li><strong>= $125,000 - Total Funding Goal</strong></li>\n</ul><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43318377\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:Timeline\">Timeline</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/318/377/2a45db5ef3779a2d55eb5a3ea38e42ce_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=pMqOyQnZqtdQVJOEF%2BONicxHny83Yq%2FzkC7cdCCx79s%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>A lot of the research, ground work, and heavy lifting has already been done in the lead-up to this Kickstarter campaign.

That's how passionate I've been about Hockey Hardware all these years. It's a project I truly believe in and want to bring to life. My goal is to make Hockey Hardware a reality for the benefit and enjoyment of hockey fans and gamers everywhere. With your pledge, successfully funding Hockey Hardware on Kickstarter would be a dream come true!</p><p>I'm 32 years old and happily married to my beautiful and supportive wife, Katherine.

I consume as much hockey as I can. While my favourite NHL team to cheer for is the Ottawa Senators, I enjoy watching all the teams play, and I respect and appreciate all the teams and their players for the entertainment value they bring to the ice. In my view, ice hockey is one of the most exciting sports to play and watch. It's always fast-paced and loaded with action, from the opening puck drop to start the first period until the final horn to end the game.</p><p>I have always enjoyed playing sports and games. Two of my all-time favourite games are Settlers of Catan and Exploding Kittens.</p><p>For many years, I've possessed an entrepreneurial drive. Hockey Hardware is my first-ever creation and this campaign is my first-ever Kickstarter.</p><p>When I'm not working on Hockey Hardware or this Kickstarter campaign, I work full-time as a Communications Advisor and Legislative Assistant in Ottawa. I graduated from the University of Guelph in 2013 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, double majoring in Environmental Governance as well as Criminal Justice and Public Policy. After Guelph, I continued my post-secondary education and graduated with a Masters degree in Political Management from Carleton University in 2014.</p><p>I firmly believe hockey is for everyone, and so is Hockey Hardware.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"40931631\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<h3 class=\"invisible page-anchor\" id=\"h:About-FACE-OFF-GAMES\">About FACE-OFF GAMES</h3>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/040/931/631/dc7b6501a3d244333fd04af22e8f7283_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=LgEEeUXfKVMMglbGtQbOAO78pYKjwxrLlEDyHjiYvH0%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>As Hockey Hardware's potential grew stronger and brighter, I realized there was a need to establish a business entity for tax, administration, and organizational purposes to help design and develop Hockey Hardware, and eventually, aspire to market and sell it in the marketplace.</p><p>In February 2022, I registered a business with the Province of Ontario. I decided to call it FACE-OFF GAMES. I feel the name accurately reflects the competitive nature of the games that I enjoy playing, while at the same time, compliments its flagship brand, Hockey Hardware.</p><p>FACE-OFF GAMES values fun, fairness, and inclusivity. It is always important to be respectful and kind to others, and to treat everyone the way we want to be treated. Hockey is for everyone, and so is Hockey Hardware.</p><p>FACE-OFF GAMES aspires to become an independent game design studio that will create, develop, market, and sell various game brands, products, and merchandise for the enjoyment and entertainment of our fans everywhere.</p>",

It's like nothing else, and yet there are familiar themes. It's a pattern-making game in which players attempt to get their pegs into a \"rendezvous\" area on the board. The rendezvous is different for every round, and can actually move during the game. Very interesting, sometimes surprising, and a bit of a brain-teaser.</p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43690222\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/690/222/f0fa63f60def82e612d694bd8b5ab351_original.jpg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=mRZp0dOHZC9at7ko9UTR4ApgbSWyNuiAZDbRp%2FHOBw8%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<p>Korea's long and rich history provides us with a host of traditional games from light-weight children's games to heavier strategic challenges.

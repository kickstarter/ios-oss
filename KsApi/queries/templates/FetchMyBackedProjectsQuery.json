We have always had great interest in both golf and card games. Our grandparents introduced us to the card game \"Card Golf\" a couple years back, and we instantly loved it. However, after over a year of playing the game, we thought to ourselves - \"there must be a way to make card golf more competitive and play more like the actual game of golf.\" Thus, Card Golf Tour was born.  </strong></p><p><strong>Card Golf Tour improves on the traditional game of card golf by introducing: </strong></p><ul>\n<li><strong>A deck of playing cards that replicates a set of golf clubs.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>An innovative scoring system that allows players to score eagles, birdies, pars, and bogeys.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A unique par system that changes the duration of the hand.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>An optional proprietary stroke index system that varies the difficulty level from hand to hand.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Multiple game formats, including scramble, alternate shot, and match play.</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Our mission with Card Golf Tour is twofold; We want to help people learn about the game of golf while also creating a competitive and strategic card game that appeals to avid golfers and card players alike. We are running our Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the production of our first 100 units of Card Golf Tour.

Card Golf Tour is designed to be played with a group of 2-5 players and will take anywhere from 10-90 minutes based on the amount of hands you play. Listed is below is a brief guide to Card Golf Tour as well as an instructional video on our YouTube channel.</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Note-Composition-of-the-deck\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Note: Composition of the deck</strong></h4><p><strong>Each deck of Card Golf Tour playing cards includes 54 cards. There are 14 types of cards in the deck:</strong></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Putter (-5 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Driver (-2 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hybrid (0 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>1 Iron (1 point)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2 Iron (2 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>3 Iron (3 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>4 Iron (4 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>5 Iron (5 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>6 Iron (6 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>7 Iron (7 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>8 Iron (8 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>9 Iron (9 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Pitching Wedge (10 points)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Sand Wedge (11 points)</strong></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Each type of card has 4 cards in the deck, 2 green cards of the respective type and 2 black cards. The exception to this is the putter card, in which there are only two putters in the deck, one black putter and one green putter (think of the putter as the joker of a standard deck of playing cards).</strong></p><p><strong>In Card Golf Tour, the lower the point value of the card, the more valuable that card is. This means that the putter is typically the best card in the deck while the sand wedge is typically the worst card in the deck.</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Setup-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Setup:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- The dealer will shuffle the deck of cards and then deal. Each player will be dealt 4, 6, or 8 cards face down based on the par of the hole (dealer will reference the scorecard for the par of the hole). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- The dealer will then place the remaining cards in the the center of the table, forming the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile will then be turned over and placed next to the draw pile forming the discard pile. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Each player will arrange their cards in two horizontal rows of 2, 3, or 4 cards based on how many cards they were dealt. They will then chose 1, 2, or 3 cards to turn face up based on the amount of cards they were dealt. </strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Play-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Play:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- Each player will roll the dice to determine order of play. The lowest roll will be player 1, and the lowest dice roll between the player to the right and left of player 1 will be player 2. Play will then continue in this direction for the remainder of the hole. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- Through a series of drawing, matching, keeping, and discarding cards players will attempt to minimize their hands point total (see our instructional video attached below for further explanation of this facet of the game). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Once one player has all of their cards face up on the table, the hand ends and each remaining player is allowed one more turn. </strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Score-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Score:</strong></h4><p><strong>Step 1- Each player will find the sum of their hand. </strong></p><p><strong>Step 2- Each player will then find the score to par that their hand total falls under (see our instructional video below for further information on the scoring system in Card Golf Tour). </strong></p><p><strong>Step 3- Each player will then report their score on the hole to the scorekeeper who will keep a running tally of each players score throughout the round.</strong></p><p><strong>Note- Each step outlined above will be repeated for each subsequent hand in the game. It is recommended that the group plays either 9 or 18 hands, just like how golfers usually play 9 or 18 holes in a round.</strong></p><p><strong>At the conclusion of the game, the player with the lowest score is the winner!</strong></p><h4 id=\"h:Instructional-Video-\" class=\"page-anchor\"><strong>Instructional Video:</strong></h4><div class=\"template oembed\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqyncJx4_7w&amp;t=217s\">\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h:What-Tour-Players-Are-Saying-\" class=\"page-anchor\">What <em>Tour</em> Players Are Saying...</h3><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43565382\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/565/382/19d8db0e683aabdacaa38991f74f992e_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=nsbjyTP0A6p8sklIon%2BQmNAuSyYFXv%2FwubrEQthOCvc%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43565383\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/565/383/fae24670ca5f24f32264af3623f69ff3_original.png?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;width=700&amp;sig=rp13w8EsSHlTzGS0hjHjUAWoHDEtF4Uy5V9aVyXTHcY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43649919\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/649/919/1fad42f0e34dee859cd2c6bebd5b2ff2_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=qTvayef%2F2Xb0hGGpDYROjqCXO%2BWltuh8dH28Ns6EikQ%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h:Stretch-Goals\" class=\"page-anchor\">Stretch Goals</h3><p><strong>At Card Golf Tour, we have decided not to use stretch goals as a part of our crowdfunding campaign. Our reasoning for this is simple.</strong></p><p><strong>We want to ensure that each backer who pledges to the campaign will be able to open their box and immediately begin playing Card Golf Tour. Some Kickstarter campaigns withhold certain components of their game and use them as a reward for a stretch goal. At Card Golf Tour, we have designed our game holistically so that no add-ons are necessary in order to play our game. While we have designed many different ways to play Card Golf Tour, we have decided that we will release these updates to the game at scheduled times throughout the upcoming year to keep the game feeling new and exciting. </strong></p><p><strong>Our team at Card Golf Tour is using our Kickstarter campaign as a proof of concept campaign. We do not intend to make a profit on our product using Kickstarter, but rather, want to use our campaign to spread awareness about our game. Card Golf Tour is a hobby for us, not a job.</strong></p><h3 id=\"h:Shipping\" class=\"page-anchor\">Shipping</h3><p><strong>Our team at Card Golf Tour has made the decision to only ship within the United States. Shipping will be $5 to anywhere within the U.S and no matter the pledge level. </strong></p><p><strong>Backers may notice that we have set March 2024 as our targeted delivery date for our product. This is an unusually short turnaround as our campaign will be ending on February 25th. The reason for this is that we have already produced our first 100 copies of Card Golf Tour. This means that once the campaign ends, assuming it has met its goal, we will be able to immediately begin the process of shipping out our game to backers. While we anticipate that shipping will take 1-2 weeks, we cannot guarantee anything and will make sure to provide continued updates as needed.</strong></p><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-id=\"43738194\">\n<figure class=\"image\">\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"fit\" src=\"https://i-dev.kickstarter.com/assets/043/738/194/e3dd541b4f9566d12c139b7f4f707457_original.jpeg?fit=contain&amp;origin=ugc-qa&amp;q=92&amp;width=700&amp;sig=rL1B%2BaBj4PWcjvJMGE8kR6OOGIAmbKNy5RQy3nPTuiY%3D\">\n</figure>\n\n</div>\n",

defensive enemies.</li>\n<li>The game encourages players to find enemies' weaknesses through observation and adaptation, using guard-breaking attacks to break stalemates.</li>\n<li>Combat interactions and reaction timings require players to stay alert and flexible, increasing the game's challenge and enjoyment.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"template asset\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-alt-text=\"\"

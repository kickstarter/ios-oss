/**

  Represents a tooltip to be displayed next to a Facebook login button
  to highlight features for new users.


 The `FBSDKLoginButton` may display this view automatically. If you do
  not use the `FBSDKLoginButton`, you can manually call one of the `present*` methods
  as appropriate and customize behavior via `FBSDKLoginTooltipViewDelegate` delegate.

  By default, the `FBSDKLoginTooltipView` is not added to the superview until it is
  determined the app has migrated to the new login experience. You can override this
  (e.g., to test the UI layout) by implementing the delegate or setting `forceDisplay` to YES.

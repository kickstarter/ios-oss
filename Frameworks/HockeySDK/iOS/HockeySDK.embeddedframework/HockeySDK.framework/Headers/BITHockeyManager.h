/** 
 The HockeySDK manager. Responsible for setup and management of all components
 
 This is the principal SDK class. It represents the entry point for the HockeySDK. The main promises of the class are initializing the SDK modules, providing access to global properties and to all modules. Initialization is divided into several distinct phases:
 
 1. Setup the [HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) app identifier and the optional delegate: This is the least required information on setting up the SDK and using it. It does some simple validation of the app identifier and checks if the app is running from the App Store or not.
 2. Provides access to the SDK modules `BITCrashManager`, `BITUpdateManager`, and `BITFeedbackManager`. This way all modules can be further configured to personal needs, if the defaults don't fit the requirements.
 3. Configure each module.
 4. Start up all modules.
 
 The SDK is optimized to defer everything possible to a later time while making sure e.g. crashes on startup can also be caught and each module executes other code with a delay some seconds. This ensures that applicationDidFinishLaunching will process as fast as possible and the SDK will not block the startup sequence resulting in a possible kill by the watchdog process.

 All modules do **NOT** show any user interface if the module is not activated or not integrated.
 `BITCrashManager`: Shows an alert on startup asking the user if he/she agrees on sending the crash report, if `[BITCrashManager crashManagerStatus]` is set to `BITCrashManagerStatusAlwaysAsk` (default)
 `BITUpdateManager`: Is automatically deactivated when the SDK detects it is running from a build distributed via the App Store. Otherwise if it is not deactivated manually, it will show an alert after startup informing the user about a pending update, if one is available. If the user then decides to view the update another screen is presented with further details and an option to install the update.
 `BITFeedbackManager`: If this module is deactivated or the user interface is nowhere added into the app, this module will not do anything. It will not fetch the server for data or show any user interface. If it is integrated, activated, and the user already used it to provide feedback, it will show an alert after startup if a new answer has been received from the server with the option to view it.
 
 Example:
 
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager]
      configureWithIdentifier:@"<AppIdentifierFromHockeyApp>"
                     delegate:nil];
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager];
 
 @warning The SDK is **NOT** thread safe and has to be set up on the main thread!
 
 @warning Most properties of all components require to be set **BEFORE** calling`startManager`!

/**
 Initializes the manager with an app identifier for beta, one for live usage and delegate
 
 Initialize the manager with different HockeyApp app identifiers for beta and live usage.
 All modules will automatically detect if the app is running in the App Store and use
 the live app identifier for that. In all other cases it will use the beta app identifier.
 And also assign the class that implements the optional protocols `BITHockeyManagerDelegate`,
 `BITCrashManagerDelegate` or `BITUpdateManagerDelegate`
 
    [[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager]

                         delegate:nil];

 We recommend using one app entry on HockeyApp for your beta versions and another one for
 your live versions. The reason is that you will have way more beta versions than live
 versions, but on the other side get way more crash reports on the live version. Separating
 them into two different app entries makes it easier to work with the data. In addition
 you will likely end up having the same version number for a beta and live version which
 would mix different data into the same version. Also the live version does not require
 you to upload any IPA files, uploading only the dSYM package for crash reporting is
 just fine.

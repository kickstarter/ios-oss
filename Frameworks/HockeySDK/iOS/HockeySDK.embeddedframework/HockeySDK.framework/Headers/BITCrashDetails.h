 Indicates if the app was killed while being in foreground from the iOS
 
 If `[BITCrashManager enableAppNotTerminatingCleanlyDetection]` is enabled, use this on startup
 to check if the app starts the first time after it was killed by iOS in the previous session.
 
 This can happen if it consumed too much memory or the watchdog killed the app because it
 took too long to startup or blocks the main thread for too long, or other reasons. See Apple
 documentation: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1693/_index.html
 
 See `[BITCrashManager enableAppNotTerminatingCleanlyDetection]` for more details about which kind of kills can be detected.
 
 @warning This property only has a correct value, once `[BITHockeyManager startManager]` was
 invoked! In addition, it is automatically disabled while a debugger session is active!
 
 @see `[BITCrashManager enableAppNotTerminatingCleanlyDetection]`
 @see `[BITCrashManager didReceiveMemoryWarningInLastSession]`
 
 @return YES if the details represent an app kill instead of a crash

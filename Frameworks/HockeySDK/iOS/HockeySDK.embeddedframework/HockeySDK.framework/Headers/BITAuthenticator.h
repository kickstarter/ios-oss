 * Identify and authenticate users of Ad-Hoc or Enterprise builds

 *
 * 1. Identifying who is running your Ad-Hoc or Enterprise builds
 *    `BITAuthenticator` provides an identifier for the rest of the HockeySDK
 *    to work with, e.g. in-app update checks and crash reports.
 *
 * 2. Optional regular checking if an identified user is still allowed
 *    to run this application. The `BITAuthenticator` can be used to make
 *    sure only users who are testers of your app are allowed to run it.
 *
 * This module automatically disables itself when running in an App Store build by default!
 *
 * @warning It is mandatory to call `authenticateInstallation` somewhen after calling
 * `[[BITHockeyManager sharedHockeyManager] startManager]` or fully customize the identification
 * and validation workflow yourself.
 * If your app shows a modal view on startup, make sure to call `authenticateInstallation`
 * either once your modal view is fully presented (e.g. its `viewDidLoad:` method is processed)
 * or once your modal view is dismissed.

 Should be used by the app-delegate to forward handle application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: calls.
 
 This is required if `identificationType` is set to `BITAuthenticatorIdentificationTypeDevice`.
 Your app needs to implement the default `ha<APP_ID>` URL scheme or register its own scheme
 via `urlScheme`.
 BITAuthenticator checks if the given URL is actually meant to be parsed by it and will
 return NO if it doesn't think so. It does this by checking the 'host'-part of the URL to be 'authorize', as well
 as checking the protocol part.
 Please make sure that if you're using a custom URL scheme, it does _not_ conflict with BITAuthenticator's.
 If BITAuthenticator thinks the URL was meant to be an authorization URL, but could not find a valid token, it will
 reset the stored identification token and state.
